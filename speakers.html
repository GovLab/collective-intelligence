              <h3>R. Luke Dubois</h3>
              <h5>Co-Director and Associate Professor of Integrated Digital Media</h5>
              <h6>NYU Tandon School of Engineering</h6>
              <p>R. Luke DuBois is a composer, artist, and performer who explores the temporal, verbal, and visual structures of cultural and personal ephemera. He holds a doctorate in music composition from Columbia University, and has lectured and taught worldwide on interactive sound and video performance. He has collaborated on interactive performance, installation, and music production work with many artists and organizations including Toni Dove, Todd Reynolds, Jamie Jewett, Bora Yoon, Michael Joaquin Grey, Matthew Ritchie, Elliott Sharp, Michael Gordon, Maya Lin, Bang on a Can, Engine 27, Harvestworks, and LEMUR, and was the director of the Princeton Laptop Orchestra for its 2007 season.</p>

<p>Stemming from his investigations of “time-lapse phonography,” his work is a sonic and encyclopedic relative to time-lapse photography. Just as a long camera exposure fuses motion into a single image, his projects reveal the average sonority, visual language, and vocabulary in music, film, text, or cultural information. Exhibitions of his work include: the Insitut Valencià d’Art Modern, Spain; Haus der elektronischen Künste, Switzerland; 2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver; Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis; San Jose Museum of Art; National Constitution Center, Philadelphia; Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art; Daelim Contemporary Art Museum, Seoul; 2007 Sundance Film Festival; the Sydney Film Festival; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; PROSPECT.2 New Orleans; and the Aspen Institute. DuBois’ work and writing has appeared in print and online in the New York Times, National Geographic, and Esquire Magazine, and he was an invited speaker at the 2016 TED Conference. A major survey of his work, NOW, received its premiere at the Ringling Museum of Art in 2014, with a catalogue published by Scala Art &amp; Heritage Publishers.</p>

<p>An active visual and musical collaborator, DuBois is the co-author of Jitter, a software suite for the real-time manipulation of matrix data developed by San Francisco-based software company Cycling’74. He appears on nearly twenty-five albums both individually and as part of the avant-garde electronic group The Freight Elevator Quartet. He currently performs as part of Bioluminescence, a duo with vocalist Lesley Flanigan that explores the modality of the human voice, and in Fair Use, a trio with Zach Layton and Matthew Ostrowski, that looks at our accelerating culture through elecronic performance and remixing of cinema.</p>

<p>DuBois has lived for the last twenty-two years in New York City. He is the director of the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and is on the Board of Directors of the ISSUE Project Room. His records are available on Caipirinha/Sire, Liquid Sky, C74, and Cantaloupe Music. His artwork is represented by bitforms gallery in New York City.</p>

              <h3>Bernardo Huberman</h3>
              <h5></h5>
              <h6>Stanford University</h6>
              <p>Bernardo Huberman was until recently an HP Senior Fellow and the Director of the Mechanisms and Design lab at HP labs. He is now in the Symbolic Systems Program at Stanford University. His work has centered in the dynamics of information and how distributed intelligence performs as it flows within networks. As part of this research he designed and implemented a globally distributed computer network that allocates resources by auctioning off computons, bundles of cpu, storage and bandwidth. The other aspect of this work involves designing and testing in the laboratory mechanisms for discovering and aggregating widely dispersed information using economic incentives. Examples are the discovery of social networks from patterns in email exchanges, the prediction of uncertain events using groups of people within a market setting, and more recently the economics of attention.</p>

              <h5>Associate Professor</h5>
              <h6>Stanford University</h6>
              <p>Nick Ouellette is an Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 2002 with majors in Physics and Computer Science, and earned his Ph.D. (in Physics) in 2006 from Cornell University, where he worked with Eberhard Bodenschatz. He held postdoctoral positions at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in 2006 (with Eberhard Bodenschatz) and in the Physics Department at Haverford College from 2007-2008 (with Jerry Gollub). Prior to working at Stanford, he spent seven years on the faculty in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Yale University.</p>

<p>Ouellette is broadly interested the behavior of complex systems far from equilibrium. In particular, a running theme in his research is dynamical self-organization. He seeks both to understand the physical principles that govern the spontaneous emergence of low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional systems and to harness this self-organization for engineering applications. His current research includes studies of turbulent flows in two and three dimensions, in both simple and complex fluids; the transport of inertial, anisotropic, and active particles in turbulence; the erosion of granular beds by fluid flows and subsequent sediment transport; and quantitative measurements of collective behavior in insect swarms and other animal groups.</p>

              <h3>Kate Starbird</h3>
              <h5>Assistant Professor</h5>
              <h6>University of Washington</h6>
              <p>Kate Starbird is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering (HCDE) and Director of the <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/emcomp">Emerging Capacities of Mass Participation (emCOMP) Laboratory</a>. Her research sits at the intersection of computer science and social science and falls within the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). One major focus of her work examines the use of social media during crisis events, specifically looking at how the converging audience (aka, the “crowd”) can contribute—and is already contributing—to crisis response efforts.</p>

<p>Using a combination of empirical methods, including qualitative, computational and network analysis, Starbird examines both small group and large scale interaction online within the context of disasters and other mass disruption events, studying how digital volunteers and other members of the crowd work to filter and shape the information space.</p>

<p>Dr. Starbird received her PhD in Technology, Media and Society from the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado in 2012, where she examined both large-scale and small group online interaction during crisis events, studying how digital volunteers and other members of the connected crowd work to filter and shape the information space. As part of that research, she co-created and developed the infrastructure to support the “Tweak the Tweet” project, an innovation for using Twitter more effectively as a channel for reporting actionable information during crisis. She was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for her PhD studies.</p>
