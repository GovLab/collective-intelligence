    in\thierarchical systems\nFor several years,\tDr. Huberman's research concentrated
    on the World Wide Web, with particular emphasis the dynamics of its growth and
    use. This work helped uncover the nature of electronic markets, as well as the
    design of novel mechanisms for enhancing privacy and trust in e-commerce and negotiations.
    With members of his group he discovered a number of strong regularities, such
    as the dynamics that govern the growth of the web, and the laws that determine
    how users surf the web and create the observed congestion patterns. In addition,
    this research helped establish and understand the winner-take-all nature of markets
    in the web, while leading to the design of several novel mechanisms for protecting
    privacy and enhancing trust in electronic communities. These results, were widely
    covered by the [press](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/people/huberman/press.html).\nPresently,

Prior to working at Stanford, he spent seven years on the faculty in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Yale University.

    Ouellette is broadly interested the behavior of complex systems far from equilibrium. In particular, a running theme in his research is dynamical self-organization. He seeks both to understand the physical principles that govern the spontaneous emergence of low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional systems and to harness this self-organization for engineering applications. His current research includes studies of turbulent flows in two and three dimensions, in both simple and complex fluids; the transport of inertial, anisotropic, and active particles in turbulence; the erosion of granular beds by fluid flows and subsequent sediment transport; and quantitative measurements of collective behavior in insect swarms and other animal groups.

    bio: "Bernardo Huberman is a Senior HP Fellow and Director of the Social Computing
      Lab at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the
      University of Pennsylvania, and is currently a Consulting Professor in the Department
      of Applied\tPhysics at Stanford University. He originally worked in condensed
      matter physics, ranging from superionic conductors to two-dimensional superfluids,
      and made contributions to the theory of critical phenomena in low dimensional
      systems. He was one of the discoverers of chaos in a number of physical systems,
      and also established a number of universal properties in nonlinear dynamical
      systems. His research into the dynamics of complex structures led to his discovery
      of ultradiffusion in\thierarchical systems\nFor several years,\tDr. Huberman's
      research concentrated on the World Wide Web, with particular emphasis the dynamics
      of its growth and use. This work helped uncover the nature of electronic markets,
      as well as the design of novel mechanisms for enhancing privacy and trust in
      e-commerce and negotiations. With members of his group he discovered a number
      of strong regularities, such as the dynamics that govern the growth of the web,
      and the laws that determine how users surf the web and create the observed congestion
      patterns. In addition, this research helped establish and understand the winner-take-all
      nature of markets in the web, while leading to the design of several novel mechanisms
      for protecting privacy and enhancing trust in electronic communities. These
      results, were widely covered by the [press](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/people/huberman/press.html).\nPresently,
      his work centers on the design of novel mechanisms for discovering and aggregating
      information in distributed systems as well as understanding the dynamics of
      information in large networks."

    bio: |-
      Nick Ouellette is an Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 2002 with majors in Physics and Computer Science, and earned his Ph.D. (in Physics) in 2006 from Cornell University, where he worked with Eberhard Bodenschatz. He held postdoctoral positions at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in 2006 (with Eberhard Bodenschatz) and in the Physics Department at Haverford College from 2007-2008 (with Jerry Gollub). Prior to working at Stanford, he spent seven years on the faculty in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Yale University.

      Ouellette is broadly interested the behavior of complex systems far from equilibrium. In particular, a running theme in his research is dynamical self-organization. He seeks both to understand the physical principles that govern the spontaneous emergence of low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional systems and to harness this self-organization for engineering applications. His current research includes studies of turbulent flows in two and three dimensions, in both simple and complex fluids; the transport of inertial, anisotropic, and active particles in turbulence; the erosion of granular beds by fluid flows and subsequent sediment transport; and quantitative measurements of collective behavior in insect swarms and other animal groups.

      research sits at the intersection of computer science and social science and
      falls within the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported
      Cooperative Work (CSCW). One major focus of her work examines the use of social
      media during crisis events, specifically looking at how the converging audience
      (aka, the \"crowd\") can contribute—and is already contributing—to crisis response
      efforts. \n\nUsing a combination of empirical methods, including qualitative,
      computational and network analysis, Starbird examines both small group and large
      scale interaction online within the context of disasters and other mass disruption
      events, studying how digital volunteers and other members of the crowd work
      to filter and shape the information space. \n\nDr. Starbird received her PhD
      in Technology, Media and Society from the ATLAS Institute at the University
      of Colorado in 2012, where she examined both large-scale and small group online
      interaction during crisis events, studying how digital volunteers and other
      members of the connected crowd work to filter and shape the information space.
      As part of that research, she co-created and developed the infrastructure to
      support the \"Tweak the Tweet\" project, an innovation for using Twitter more
      effectively as a channel for reporting actionable information during crisis.
      She was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for her PhD studies."

    bio: |
      R. Luke DuBois is a composer, artist, and performer who explores the temporal, verbal, and visual structures of cultural and personal ephemera. He holds a doctorate in music composition from Columbia University, and has lectured and taught worldwide on interactive sound and video performance. He has collaborated on interactive performance, installation, and music production work with many artists and organizations including Toni Dove, Todd Reynolds, Jamie Jewett, Bora Yoon, Michael Joaquin Grey, Matthew Ritchie, Elliott Sharp, Michael Gordon, Maya Lin, Bang on a Can, Engine 27, Harvestworks, and LEMUR, and was the director of the Princeton Laptop Orchestra for its 2007 season.

      Stemming from his investigations of “time-lapse phonography,” his work is a sonic and encyclopedic relative to time-lapse photography. Just as a long camera exposure fuses motion into a single image, his projects reveal the average sonority, visual language, and vocabulary in music, film, text, or cultural information. Exhibitions of his work include: the Insitut Valencià d’Art Modern, Spain; Haus der elektronischen Künste, Switzerland; 2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver; Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis; San Jose Museum of Art; National Constitution Center, Philadelphia; Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art; Daelim Contemporary Art Museum, Seoul; 2007 Sundance Film Festival; the Sydney Film Festival; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; PROSPECT.2 New Orleans; and the Aspen Institute. DuBois' work and writing has appeared in print and online in the New York Times, National Geographic, and Esquire Magazine, and he was an invited speaker at the 2016 TED Conference. A major survey of his work, NOW, received its premiere at the Ringling Museum of Art in 2014, with a catalogue published by Scala Art & Heritage Publishers.

      An active visual and musical collaborator, DuBois is the co-author of Jitter, a software suite for the real-time manipulation of matrix data developed by San Francisco-based software company Cycling'74. He appears on nearly twenty-five albums both individually and as part of the avant-garde electronic group The Freight Elevator Quartet. He currently performs as part of Bioluminescence, a duo with vocalist Lesley Flanigan that explores the modality of the human voice, and in Fair Use, a trio with Zach Layton and Matthew Ostrowski, that looks at our accelerating culture through elecronic performance and remixing of cinema.

      DuBois has lived for the last twenty-two years in New York City. He is the director of the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and is on the Board of Directors of the ISSUE Project Room. His records are available on Caipirinha/Sire, Liquid Sky, C74, and Cantaloupe Music. His artwork is represented by bitforms gallery in New York City.
