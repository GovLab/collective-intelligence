    His research into the dynamics of complex structures led to his discovery of ultradiffusion
    in\thierarchical systems\nFor several years,\tDr. Huberman's research concentrated
    on the World Wide Web, with particular emphasis the dynamics of its growth and
    use. This work helped uncover the nature of electronic markets, as well as the
    design of novel mechanisms for enhancing privacy and trust in e-commerce and negotiations.
    With members of his group he discovered a number of strong regularities, such
    as the dynamics that govern the growth of the web, and the laws that determine
    how users surf the web and create the observed congestion patterns. In addition,
    this research helped establish and understand the winner-take-all nature of markets
    in the web, while leading to the design of several novel mechanisms for protecting
    privacy and enhancing trust in electronic communities. These results, were widely
    covered by the [press](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/people/huberman/press.html).\nPresently,
    his work centers on the design of novel mechanisms for discovering and aggregating
    information in distributed systems as well as understanding the dynamics of information

      Lab at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the

      of Applied\tPhysics at Stanford University. He originally worked in condensed
      matter physics, ranging from superionic conductors to two-dimensional superfluids,
      and made contributions to the theory of critical phenomena in low dimensional
      systems. He was one of the discoverers of chaos in a number of physical systems,
      and also established a number of universal properties in nonlinear dynamical
      systems. His research into the dynamics of complex structures led to his discovery
      of ultradiffusion in\thierarchical systems\nFor several years,\tDr. Huberman's
      research concentrated on the World Wide Web, with particular emphasis the dynamics
      of its growth and use. This work helped uncover the nature of electronic markets,
      as well as the design of novel mechanisms for enhancing privacy and trust in
      e-commerce and negotiations. With members of his group he discovered a number
      of strong regularities, such as the dynamics that govern the growth of the web,
      and the laws that determine how users surf the web and create the observed congestion
      patterns. In addition, this research helped establish and understand the winner-take-all
      nature of markets in the web, while leading to the design of several novel mechanisms
      for protecting privacy and enhancing trust in electronic communities. These
      results, were widely covered by the [press](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/people/huberman/press.html).\nPresently,
      his work centers on the design of novel mechanisms for discovering and aggregating
      information in distributed systems as well as understanding the dynamics of
      information in large networks."

    bio: "Kate Starbird is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Centered
      Design & Engineering (HCDE) and Director of the [Emerging Capacities of Mass
      Participation (emCOMP) Laboratory](http://www.hcde.washington.edu/emcomp). Her
      research sits at the intersection of computer science and social science and
      falls within the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported
      Cooperative Work (CSCW). One major focus of her work examines the use of social
      media during crisis events, specifically looking at how the converging audience
      (aka, the \"crowd\") can contribute—and is already contributing—to crisis response
      efforts. \n\nUsing a combination of empirical methods, including qualitative,
      computational and network analysis, Starbird examines both small group and large
      scale interaction online within the context of disasters and other mass disruption
      events, studying how digital volunteers and other members of the crowd work
      to filter and shape the information space. \n\nDr. Starbird received her PhD
      in Technology, Media and Society from the ATLAS Institute at the University
      of Colorado in 2012, where she examined both large-scale and small group online
      interaction during crisis events, studying how digital volunteers and other
      members of the connected crowd work to filter and shape the information space.
      As part of that research, she co-created and developed the infrastructure to
      support the \"Tweak the Tweet\" project, an innovation for using Twitter more
      effectively as a channel for reporting actionable information during crisis.
      She was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for her PhD studies."
